# ARM Account Login

## Overview

ARM Data is stored in the ARM Data Center (ADC) at Oak Ridge National Laboratory. If you're interested in available data for a given area and time of interest, the [ARM Data Portal](https://adc.arm.gov/) portal provides a convenient web interface.

## Why do I need an ARM Data login?

Each participant will need a login. We will be teaching you ways to programmatically access ARM data from within your Python scripts. You will need to enter your ARM username and password in order for this to work.

## Getting an ARM Data login

If you do not already have an ARM Data login, then navigate to the [ARM Login](https://adc.arm.gov/armuserreg/) page, select
